# Project Name: Dream BPL - Select Your XI

## Short Description
"Dream BPL - Select Your XI" is an interactive and fully responsive web application built with React. It empowers users to select and manage their cricket teams by browsing player data fetched from a JSON file. Users can earn free coins through a dedicated button in the banner section and strategically purchase up to six players to create their ultimate team. This user-friendly platform combines strategy and excitement, making cricket team management an enjoyable experience.

## Problem I Have Faced
This is my first React project, "Dream BPL - Select Your XI," I encountered challenges while fetching player data from a JSON file. Implementing props, useState, and useEffect for dynamic functionalities required learning and practice. Despite these hurdles, I successfully created a responsive and user-friendly application that allows users to select and manage cricket players, enhancing my skills in React development.

## Key Features
1. **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive, user can explore it easily.
2. **Dynamic Categories**: Users can select up to six players to build and manage their team, view selected players, and easily add or remove players.

3. **Earn Free Coins**: User can earn free coin and buy players.

4. **Players Details**: Here I include each player detailed information such as name, country, price, batting type, bowling type, role etc.

- **React-Toastify**
- **Fetch Data From JSON**
- **useState**
